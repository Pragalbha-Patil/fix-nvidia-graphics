# NVIDIA graphics drivers fix

Give NVIDIA card full control over your hardware & fix screen tearing. This is tested on Linux Mint 20.1 & 20.2 UMA Cinnamon edition. 

CSGO (Steam) gives 130+ FPS after this fix, so it's pretty cool.

My hardware specs:

Intel i5 9300H 9th Gen

NVIDIA GTX 1650 MaxQ Graphics card
